`rave` is a work-in-progress audio and video library with a focus on streaming applications.

## üõ† Status

`rave` is under heavy development and not ready for use yet.

## üéØ Goals

* Easy-to-use and safe API.
* Quality over quantity (well-behaved encoders and decoders over many codecs).
* Minimize the number of external non-Rust dependencies.

Note that `rave` is not meant to be a replacement for `ffmpeg`. Use `ffmpeg` if you need support for
many formats and codecs.
