`rave` is a work-in-progress audio and video library with a focus on streaming applications.

## üõ† Status

`rave` is under heavy development and not ready for use yet.

## üéØ Goals

* Easy-to-use and safe API.
* Quality over quantity (well-behaved encoders and decoders over many codecs).
* Minimize the number of external non-Rust dependencies.

Note that `rave` is not meant to be a replacement for `ffmpeg`. Use `ffmpeg` if you need support for
many formats and codecs.

## ‚ú® Credits

`rave` only exists thanks to the following organizations and people:

* Everyone who worked on [video-rs](https://github.com/oddity-ai/video-rs)!
* [Cisco](https://cisco.com) for developing [openh264](https://github.com/cisco/openh264).
* [Ralf Biedert](https://github.com/ralfbiedert) for maintaining [`openh264-rs`](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/openh264-rs), a Rust wrapper for `openh264`.
* [Provincie Utrecht](https://www.provincie-utrecht.nl/) for supporting this project as part of the "Situational Awareness Software" project.
* The [FFmpeg project](https://ffmpeg.org/) for `ffmpeg` and the `ffmpeg` libraries.
